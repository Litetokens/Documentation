# XLT Migration Notice
 
**Dear investors,**

LITETOKENS Mainnet is launching soon. 

Token migration from ERC20 XLT to Mainnet XLT will occur between June 21st – June 25th (GMT+8).

If your XLT is held on an exchange, no action is required.

If your XLT is held in a wallet, you must deposit your XLT to an exchange before June 24, 2018 to avoid any losses.

From June 21st– 25th, XLT withdrawals on exchanges will be suspended. On June 25th, both XLT deposits and withdraws on exchanges will be suspended. Deposits and withdraws will resume on June 26th. During this period, XLT trading will not be affected. 
If your XLT is held in a wallet and you were not aware of the migration notice, or saw the migration notice after June 25th, please visit our permanent token-exchange counter to exchange your tokens for Mainnet XLT.
