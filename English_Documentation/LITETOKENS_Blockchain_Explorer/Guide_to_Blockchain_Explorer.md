# Guide to Blockchain explorer

Use the block explorer at https://scan.litetokens.co.

## Blockchain module

### Block search

Information on all blocks—from the genesis block to all current blocks—can be found on this page, including block height, its previous block and the corresponding byte size. You can also use the search bar to check block height and LE nodes.

### Transaction search

You can search for transaction records on this page. Information on the sender and the recipient’s address, the amount of XLT transferred, block height of transaction record, corresponding Hash and production time can all be found. You can also use the search bar to look for a specific transaction by Hash.

### Check address/transaction statistics

On the statistics page, we can see figures of the top 25 XLT holders, XLT transferred in the past hour, transactions in the past hour and the trend of average block size. 'The Litescan will continue to create more data visualizations for the users' convenience.

### Check block Live

Block Live is a special feature of Litescan, with which users can check the real-time transaction records, votes, token issuance and participation, and nodes. We can also use filters to view only our desired contents.

### Check node information

This page shows the number of nodes and the country with most nodes.

This page shows the geographical distribution of LITETOKENS’s nodes. From the density of nodes in different regions, users can have a straightforward impression of where they are located. With the embedded Google map, users can zoom in and out of the map to know about the specific details.

This page shows the following information on the nodes: IP address, hostname, block height, GPRC, GPRC m/s and time of the last update.

## Check LE and LE candidate information

Users can check out the Envoy list which includes information on the last block, number of blocks produced, number of blocks missed, productivity and votes.

## Tokens

Users can participate in token offerings, get information through token overview or create their own tokens.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ybhgenius/Documentation/master/images/Blockchain-Explorer/关于代币/三大模块.png)

To participate in token offerings, click on PARTICIPATE and enter an amount to XLT to purchase a certain type of token.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ybhgenius/Documentation/master/images/Blockchain-Explorer/关于代币/参与代币.png)

Users can also view information on all tokens, including their name, total supply, total amount issued and the registration date.

Users can also create their own tokens. Click on CREATE to enter the token creation page, fill in token details, click ISSUE TOKEN and their own token can be successfully issued.
             
Token creation is very simple in LITETOKENS ecosystem. Just set up the required parameters and you are done. The parameters are as follows:
            
+ Token name
+ Total supply
+ Token description
+ Website URL: to provide users with more information on the token they are purchasing.
+ Token exchange rate with XLT.
+ Participation period: during the participation period, users can exchange XLT for tokens.
            
A one-time service charge of 1024 XLT is required to create token.

### 7. Freeze XLT prior to voting for LE candidates.

+ Click FREEZE in your account.
+ Enter the amount of XLT you’d like to freeze.
+ Check “I confirm to freeze ***XLT for a least of 3 days.”
+ Click FREEZE BALANCE to freeze XLT.

**Freezing Note**  

Only XLT can be frozen. Freezing XLT enables two additional features: get Litetokens Power and bandwidth. With TPs, users can vote for LE candidates. When XLT is unfrozen, previous votes will lose effect, which can be avoided by refreezing XLT. Bandwidth points will not be cleared when XLT is unfrozen. New bandwidth points will be accumulated upon the next XLT freeze.

### 8. To vote for LE candidates, find VOTEs in the navigation bar and click START VOTING.

### 9. Select an Envoy and enter the voting page. Enter an amount of votes and click SUBMIT VOTES to cast your votes. You will be shown a notice for successful submission.

**Voting Note** 

Enter an amount of votes to vote for an LE candidate. Voting requires TPs, which can be obtained through freezing XLT at 1 XLT for 1 TP. 1 TP equals 1 vote. When XLT is unfrozen, previous votes will lose effect, which can be avoided by refreezing XLT. Your vote will be successful as long as the number of votes casted is no more than the amount of TPs owned. You can cast as many votes as you like for an LE candidate. A successful vote submission costs 10^5 bandwidth points, unless it is 10s or more away from the previous contract (vote, transfer or XLT freeze). If TPs are insufficient for your submitted vote, you will be notified of insufficient frozen XLT. Only the latest vote submission counts (the last vote will overwrite all previous votes).

**Voting rules:**  
+ The maximal votes a user can cast should be no more than his/her holding of XLT.
+ Each user can vote for multiple candidates for multiple times.
+ The LE list is updated once every 6 hours.
+ Voting does not cost any XLT.
