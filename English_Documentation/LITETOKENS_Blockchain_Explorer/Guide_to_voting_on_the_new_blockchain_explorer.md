## 6. Only users with XLT are allowed to vote. Request of free testing XLT is only supported on the testnet at https://test.scan.litetokens.co/#/. 10,000XLT can be claimed at the bottom of the account page to vote and only one claim can be made by every account. Once XLT is successfully claimed, account balance can be viewed in WALLET.

## 7. A certain amount of XLT has to be frozen in order to vote for Envoys.
 
+ To freeze balance, click the FREEZE button in ACCOUNT. 
+ Enter the amount of XLT youâ€™d like to freeze.
+ Check the box to confirm freezing ****XLT for at least 3 days.
+ Click FREEZE BALANCE to complete your freeze.

**Note**  

Only XLT can be frozen. Two things can be obtained through balance freezing: LITETOKENS Power(TP) and bandwidth. LITETOKENS Power(TP) are used for voting. In the event of unfrozen balance, votes previously casted will no longer be valid, which can be prevented by refreezing balance. Bandwidth Points will not be cleared when balance unfreezes, instead, new bandwidth points will be accumulated at the next freeze.

## 8. To vote for Envoys, click on VOTES in the navigation bar to enter voting page and then click START VOTING.

**Note**
 
Once you have submitted the amount of votes, the vote is complete. Voting requires LITETOKENS Power(TP), which can be obtained by freezing XLT. You will receive 1 LITETOKENS Power(TP) for each frozen XLT. You will get 1 vote for each LITETOKENS Power(TP). Previous votes will no longer be valid when XLT is unfrozen. Voting will be successful as long as total votes casted do not exceed total LITETOKENS Power(TP). There is no limit to the number of votes casted for a single Envoy.  If your LITETOKENS Power(TP) balance is insufficient, the user will be alerted on insufficient frozen balance. Only the last vote will be recorded, meaning that the last vote replaces all previous voting records.

**Voting Guidelines**
+ The maximum votes a user has must be no more than his/her holding of frozen XLT.
+ Every user can vote for multiple candidates for multiple times.
+ The Envoy list is updated every 6 hours.
+ No XLT will be consumed for voting.
